# Week 8

This lab will demonstrate the Continuous Integration (CI) practice for an Agile software development process. The GitLab hosted service will provide the CI platform, and the Movies Fan React app will be the project under construction. On completing this lab, GitLab will be responsible for building/bundling the app, running all E2E tests, and publishing the test results to the Cypress dashboard.
